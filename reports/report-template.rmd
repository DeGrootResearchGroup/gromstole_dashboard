```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library("here") # All paths relative to the directory with a .git folder
    # here("scripts", "plots.R") will always find plots.R,
    # no matter where this rmd's working directory is

```

```{r sourceascript, eval=FALSE}
source(here("scripts", "plot.R")) # won't run - files don't exist on my machine
```

## python code

You can also include python code, for example:

```{python thisisapythonchunk}
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1,2,3])
x.mean()
```
